      "Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself. Who in the world am I? Ah, that\'s the great puzzle. The more he gave away, the more delighted he became. Those who don\'t believe in magic will never find it. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live. Today was good. Today was fun. Tomorrow is another one.",
      "You seemed so far away, Miss Honey whispered, awestruck. I think I can. I think I can. I think I can. I know I can. Imagination is the only weapon in the war against reality. I don\'t think... then you shouldn\'t talk, said the Hatter. I\'ve heard tell that what you imagine sometimes comes true.",
      "Children are not so serious as grown-ups and love to laugh. Somewhere inside all of us is the power to change the world. Don\'t you know that everybody\'s got a Fairyland of their own? You have been my friend. That in itself is a tremendous thing. The things that make me different are the things that make me.",
      "A little nonsense now and then, is relished by the wisest men. We all can dance, he said, if we find the music that we love. You should never, never doubt something that no one is sure of. I am not afraid of storms, for I am learning how to sail my ship. If you don\'t know where you are going any road can take you there",
      "Alice:How long is forever? White Rabbit:Sometimes, just one second. How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard. Ah, music, he said, wiping his eyes. A magic beyond all we do here! It is most unlikely. But - here comes the big \'but\' -s not impossible. It is when we are most lost that we sometimes find our truest friends.",
      "I\'m afraid I can\'t explain myself, sir. Because I am not myself, you see? Having power is not nearly as important as what you choose to do with it. You sort of start thinking anything\'s possible if you\'ve got enough nerve. Anyone can ask questions, said Mr. Wonka. It\'s the answers that count. Sometimes, I\'ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.",
      "It\'s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then. I was walking along looking for somebody, and then suddenly I wasn\'t anymore. So many things are possible just as long as you don\'t know they\'re impossible. Sometimes, said Pooh, the smallest things take up the most room in your heart. A little consideration, a little thought for others, makes all the difference. Nothing is any fun if you can get as much of it as you want. Especially money. The moment you doubt whether you can fly, you cease forever to be able to do it."

      "It doesn\'t matter who you are or what you look like, so long as somebody loves you. Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can\'t see where it keeps its brain. Happiness can be found in the darkest of times if only one remembers to turn on the light. \"Oh, I was. I was flying past the stars on silver wings,\" Matilda said. \"It was wonderful.\" If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.",
     "It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye. There is nothing sweeter in this sad world than the sound of someone you love calling your name. The sun was rising behind her now; she could feel the heat on her back, and it gave her courage. One of the advantages of being disorganized is that one is always having surprising discoveries. You\'re mad, bonkers, completely off your head. But I\'ll tell you a secret. All the best people are.",
      "And so for a time it looked as if all the adventures were coming to an end; but that was not to be. In every job that must be done, there is an element of fun. You find the fun, and the job\'s a game. If everybody minded their own business, the world would go around a great deal faster than it does. There are a whole lot of things in this world of ours you haven\'t even started wondering about yet. \"Begin at the beginning,\" the King said, very gravely, \"and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\"",
      "However small the chance might be of striking lucky, the chance is there. The chance had to be there. And Max, the king of all wild things, was lonely and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all. But in truth,\" said Bull, \"we are going nowhere. That my friend, is the irony of our constant movement.\" If things start happening, don\'t worry, don\'t stew, just go right along and you\'ll start happening too. Love is taking a few steps backward maybe even moreâ€¦to give way to the happiness of the person you love.",
      "\"Don\'t argue, my dear child, please don\'t argue!\" cried Mr. Wonka. \"It\'s such a waste of precious time!\" It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. Piglet noticed that even though he had a very small heart, it could hold a rather large amount of gratitude. Don\'t worry about the bits you can\'t understand. Sit back and allow the words to wash around you, like music. You can\'t pick out the pieces you like and leave the rest. Being part of the whole thing, that\'s the blessing.",
      "Who knows, my friend? Maybe the sword does have some magic. Personally, I think it's the warrior who wields it. \"We must hurry!\" said Mr. Wonka. \"We have so much time and so little to do! No! Wait! Strike that! Reverse it!\" You can\'t stay in your corner of the Forest waiting for others to come to you. You have to go to them sometimes. There is little point in teaching anything backwards. The whole object of life, Headmistress, is to go forwards.",
      "\"I am not worried, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. \"I am with you.\" \"The truth.\" Dumbledore sighed. \"It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.\" Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. Promise me you\'ll always remember: You\'re braver than you believe, and stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think. I think we dream so we don\'t have to be apart for so long. If we\'re in each other\'s dreams, we can be together all the time.",
      "I don't understand it any more than you do, but one thing I've learned is that you don't have to understand things for them to be. Don\'t underestimate the value of doing nothing, of just going along, listening to all the things you can\'t hear, and not bothering. My dear, here we must run as fast as we can, just to stay in place. And if you wish to go anywhere you must run twice as fast as that. I wished she'd never stop squeezing me. I wished I could spend the rest of my life as a child, being slightly crushed by someone who loved me. Words can be worrisome, people complex, motives and manners unclear. Grant her the wisdom to choose her path right, free from unkindness and fear.",
      "Keep all your promises, don't take what doesn't belong to you, and always look after those less fortunate than yourself, and you'll do well in the world. I am what I am, an\' I\'m not ashamed. \'Never be ashamed,\' my ol\' dad used ter say, \'there\'s some who\'ll hold it against you, but they\'re not worth botherin\' with. Never do anything by halves if you want to get away with it. Be outrageous. Go the whole hog. Make sure everything you do is so completely crazy it\'s unbelievable. But it isn\'t easy, said Pooh. Because poetry and hums aren\'t things which you get, they\'re things which get you. And all you can do is to go where they can find you. So the music is saying something to them. It is sending a message. I do not think the human beans is knowing what that message is, but they is loving it just the same.",
      "\"Poor Earthworm,\" the Ladybird said, whispering in James\'s ear. \"He loves to make everything into a disaster. He hates to be happy. He is only happy when he is gloomy.\" Sometimes, if you stand on the bottom rail of a bridge and lean over to watch the river slipping slowly away beneath you, you will suddenly know everything there is to be known. When someone is crying, of course, the noble thing to do is to comfort them. But if someone is trying to hide their tears, it may also be noble to pretend you do not notice them. It\'s a funny thing about mothers and fathers. Even when their own child is the most disgusting little blister you could ever imagine, they still think that he or she is wonderful. \"The matter with human beans,\" the BFG went on, \"is that they is absolutely refusing to believe in anything unless they is actually seeing it right in front of their own schnozzles.\"",
      "Watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you, because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don\'t who don\'t believe in magic will never find it. Oh, books, what books they used to know, Those children living long ago! So please, oh please, we beg, we pray, Go throw your TV set away, And in its place you can install A lovely bookshelf on the wall.",
      "George didn\'t say a word. He felt quite trembly. He knew something tremendous had taken place that morning. For a few brief moments he had touched with the very tips of his fingers the edge of a magic world.",
      "You must never feel badly about making mistakes ... as long as you take the trouble to learn from them. For you often learn more by being wrong for the right reasons than you do by being right for the wrong reasons.",
      "Well, maybe it started that way. As a dream, but doesn\'t everything. Those buildings. These lights. This whole city. Somebody had to dream about it first. And maybe that is what I did. I dreamed about coming here, but then I did it.",
      "A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts it will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.",
      "Bunkum and tummyrot! You\'ll never get anywhere if you go about what-iffing like that. Would Columbus have discovered America if he\'d said \'What if I sink on the way over? What if I meet pirates? What if I never come back?\' He wouldn\'t even have started!",
      "If ever there is tomorrow when we\'re not together... there is something you must always remember. You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think. But the most important thing is, even if we\'re apart... I\'ll always be with you.",
      "The books transported her into new worlds and introduced her to amazing people who lived exciting lives. She went on olden-day sailing ships with Joseph Conrad. She went to Africa with Ernest Hemingway and to India with Rudyard Kipling. She travelled all over the world while sitting in her little room in an English village.",
      "I began to realize how important it was to be an enthusiast in life. He taught me that if you are interested in something, no matter what it is, go at it at full speed ahead. Embrace it with both arms, hug it, love it and above all become passionate about it. Lukewarm is no good. Hot is no good either. White hot and passionate is the only thing to be.",
      "Some people when they have taken too much and have been driven beyond the point of endurance, simply crumble and give up. There are others, though they are not many, who will for some reason always be unconquerable. You meet them in time of war and also in time of peace. They have an indomitable spirit and nothing, neither pain nor torture nor threat of death, will cause them to give up.",
      "I was glad my father was an eye-smiler. It meant he never gave me a fake smile because it\'s impossible to make your eyes twinkle if you aren\'t feeling twinkly yourself. A mouth-smile is different. You can fake a mouth-smile any time you want, simply by moving your lips. I\'ve also learned that a real mouth-smile always has an eye-smile to go with it. So watch out, I say, when someone smiles at you but his eyes stay the same. It\'s sure to be a phony.",
      "\"It doesn\'t happen all at once,\" he said. \"You become. It takes a long time. That\'s why it doesn\'t often happen to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don\'t matter at all, because once you are Real you can\'t be ugly, except to people who don\'t understand."
